## Unit 20 - Supervised Learning

### Objectives

* Model and fit several supervised learning classification models using scikit-learn.
* Conceptualize and build training and test datasets for supervised learning analysis.
* Define classification in the context of machine learning.
* Evaluate classification algorithms using a confusion matrix and classification report.
* Explain how the SVM model works as a binary classifier.
* Explain how decision trees and random forest work as classifiers and how they differ from each other.
* Explain how the KNN algorithm works as a classifier and how it differs from other classifiers.
* Apply fundamental classification algorithms, namely SVMs, random forest, decision trees, and KNN in machine learning models.
