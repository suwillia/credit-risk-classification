## Unit 20 - Supervised Learning

### Objectives

* Model and fit several supervised learning classification models using scikit-learn.
* Conceptualize and build training and test datasets for supervised learning analysis.
* Define classification in the context of machine learning.
* Evaluate classification algorithms using a confusion matrix and classification report.
* Explain how the SVM model works as a binary classifier.
* Explain how decision trees and random forest work as classifiers and how they differ from each other.
* Explain how the KNN algorithm works as a classifier and how it differs from other classifiers.
* Apply fundamental classification algorithms, namely SVMs, random forest, decision trees, and KNN in machine learning models.

## Requirements
The implementation requires uploading the lending_data.csv file to your Google Drive to access all scripts. This project leverages several libraries including pandas for data manipulation and sklearn components (balanced_accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, classification_report, train_test_split) for machine learning operations.

The analysis uses logistic regression with and without RandomOversampling.
## How to Run
In the file option, open credit_risk_classification_Sunil Williams.ipynb. Copy the required data files -lending_data.csv to the file folder in google colab. Run each line in sequential order, ensuring that the line finishes processing before proceeding to the next step
## Summary
See attached mark up file with all review and answers to tasks given.
